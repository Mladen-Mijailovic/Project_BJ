<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>Player at the begging needs to select amount of tokens to bet. After that he needs to click Play button to start the game.</p>
<p>Player and Dealer both get 2 card, where Dealer has 1 card fliped. Player can chose to Hit or Stand. If player Hits and goes over 21<br>
 he Busts and loses the round. If Player wins, he gets the same amount of tokens back.</p>
 <h3>BlackJack</h3>
 <p>If player gets 21 from first two cards, he gets a BlackJack. Reward is calculated then, 2.5 * amount = payback</p>
 <h3>Double</h3>
 <p>Double is only available when Player has in begging 2 cards where their sum is 9, 10 or 11. If Player chooses to play Double, he gets<br>
  one more card which is fliped. </p> 
 <h3>Split[WIP]</h3>
 <p>Player can chose to Split cards when first two cards are same. For example: 9 + 9, Q + Q, 3 + 3 etc. When Player Splits he uses the same amount of tokens<br>
  for other hand too. Then he splits the cards and gets one more card for each hand. He then Hits for first hand, after that he needs to click on the button<br>
  Next Hand to switch to the other hand so he can Hit. [Need to fix problems when spliting]</p>
